=head1 NAME

Mail::QmailRemoteXS - Lightweight (XS) SMTP send function based on Qmail's qmail-remote

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Mail::QmailRemoteXS;
  
  $ret = Mail::QmailRemoteXS::mail($to_domain,$from_address,$to_address,$msg,$helo,$net_timeout,$net_timeoutconnect);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a single function C<mail> that sends an e-mail message via SMTP. It uses an XS implementation of
Qmail's qmail-remote binary written in C so is very lightweight and fast (compared to Net::SMTP).

The difference between Mail::QmailRemote (IKEBE Tomohiro) and Mail::QmailRemoteXS is that the former requires
the qmail package to be installed and simply invokes a wrapper around the qmail-remote binary for each send.
This module statically links code based on qmail-remote and has no dependencies other that a working resolver.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<mail>

 $ret = Mail::QmailRemoteXS::mail($to_domain,$from_address,$to_address,$msg,$helo,$net_timeout,$net_timeoutconnect);

Send an email message $msg (which includes rfc822 headers) to $to_address from $from_address using $helo as
the SMTP HELO greeting. $net_timeoutconnect is for the initial SMTP connection and $net_timeout is for the
wait time for SMTP responses.

See Qmail's qmail-remote manpage for more information and details on the return value $ret.

=back

=head1 BUGS

Some reports of C<mail> hanging indefinitely during an SMTP session.
